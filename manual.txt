Sensor Overview:
- LIT101: Measures water level in the raw water tank (T101).
- LIT301: Measures level in the UF feed water tank.
- FIT201: Measures water flow after pump P101.
- FIT301: Measures flow rate in ultrafiltration stage.
- AIT201: Conductivity sensor – detects concentration of dissolved salts.
- AIT202: pH sensor – detects acidity or alkalinity of water.
- AIT203: ORP (oxidation-reduction potential) sensor – monitors disinfection process.
- PIT503: Pressure sensor after the reverse osmosis membrane.
- DPIT301: Differential pressure sensor across filters – used to detect clogging or pump failure.

Actuator Overview:
- MV101: Motorized valve controlling inflow into T101.
- MV201, MV301, MV303: Downstream valves in subsequent filtration stages.
- P101–P106: Pumps circulating or dosing fluids across treatment stages.
- P201–P206: Chemical dosing pumps (e.g., acid, base, chlorine).
- P301: Pumps water through the ultrafiltration unit.
- P302: Used for UF backwashing controlled by PLC6.
- P401: Pumps water through the UV dechlorination process.
- P501: Pumps water through the two-stage reverse osmosis system.
- UV401: Ultraviolet disinfection unit that can be turned ON/OFF.

All sensors and actuators operate under physics-based constraints. Use the above rules to reason about sensor inconsistencies, actuator misbehavior, or plausible adversarial manipulations.
